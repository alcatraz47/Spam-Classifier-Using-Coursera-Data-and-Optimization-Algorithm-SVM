# Spam-Classifier-Using-Coursera-Data-and-Optimization-Algorithm-SVM
By using the dataset of coursera and also using some other sources from internet to optimize the controlling parameters I have made the spam classifier algorithm. There are two kernels, one is linear kernel and other one is Gaussian kernel in this project.
